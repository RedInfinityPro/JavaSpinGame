## Work on List

* Need to add a popup for each rule for a visual guide.

* Add a shop window and allow the user to buy items.

* Add a leveling-up function/gain XP over time function.

* Start the wheel at a random choice.

* Move the track to show the newest items.

* Add a clear indication of rule, roll, and story buttons.

## Bugs

* When a repeat of an object is near a removed item, it automatically equips the second one; we need to fix that.

* Allow items to show notifications for all items.

* Either allow every main panel (wheel, side panel, player inventory, notepad) to overlap or close popups automatically.

* Fix the pen to move with the mouse better.
