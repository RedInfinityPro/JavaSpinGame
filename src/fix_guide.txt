## WORK LIST

* Need to add a popup for each rule for a visual guide.

* Add a shop window and allow the user to buy items.

* Add a leveling-up function/gain XP over time function.

* Start the wheel at a random choice.

* Move the track to show the newest items.

* Add a clear indication of rule, roll, and story buttons.

* Show a notification above the notepad button to indicate if it's open or not.

* Change the bonus to be a range instead of a '+number.'

## BUGS

* Only clicking on the equipped area allows for random bonuses; we need to fix that and keep the limitation in check.

* When a repeat of an object is near a removed item, it automatically equips the second one; we need to fix that.

* Don't allow multiple notifications for used items; just show the newest ones.

* Need to fix the status bar to keep updated values instead of holding values in HTML.

* Allow items to show notifications for all items.

* Update multiple status bars; only show notifications on one status bar.

* Either allow every main panel (wheel, side panel, player inventory, notepad) to overlap or close popups automatically.

* Change the randomize function for (role, bonus percentage) to have true random.
